# EXE Installer Builder
## Description
This solution is a template for building Windows Installers for .NET Core Applications

The idead is that the installer will be able to install the application on a Windows machine and create a desktop shortcut for the application all by connecting to 
GitHub and downloading the latest release of the application. Since this is open for ideas, the theory is that there will be a list of installable applications and 
the user will be able to select which application they want to install.
